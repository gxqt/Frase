# Frase.io Content Optimization: Rank 10x Faster on Google and AI Search, Advanced SEO+GEO Features, Unlimited AI Writing

You know that feeling when you stare at a blank document, trying to figure out what content will actually rank? Like playing darts in the dark, hoping something hits the bullseye. Well, Frase.io decided that whole guessing game was getting old. They built something that turns on the lights.

This isn't just another AI writing tool promising to churn out blog posts while you sip coffee. Frase combines content research, SEO optimization, and something relatively new called GEO—Generative Engine Optimization—into one platform. Think of it as your research assistant, outline creator, and optimization coach all rolled into one interface that doesn't require a PhD to navigate.

**What Makes Frase Different from the Usual SEO Tools**

Here's where things get interesting. Most SEO tools tell you what keywords to use. Some tell you how long your content should be. A few even suggest headings. Frase does all that, but it also answers a question nobody was asking five years ago: How do I get ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude to actually cite my content?

The platform pulls data from the top 20 search results for any keyword, analyzes what's working, extracts the headings competitors use, identifies the questions people actually ask, and presents everything in a dashboard that makes sense. No more opening 47 browser tabs to research a single topic. No more copying and pasting competitor headings into a messy spreadsheet.

What caught my attention while digging into user reviews is how content managers at small agencies use Frase differently than solo bloggers. The content managers create briefs and share links with writers who've never logged into the platform. The writers open the link, see the research laid out, and write without switching between tools. Meanwhile, solo bloggers use the AI writer to generate first drafts, then optimize them using the built-in SEO and GEO scores.

If you're curious about how this dual optimization actually works in practice, 👉 [check out Frase's platform here](https://www.frase.io/?via=li68) and see the interface for yourself. The dashboard shows both your traditional SEO score and your GEO score side by side, so you know whether you're optimizing for Google's algorithms or AI's citation patterns—or ideally, both.

**The GEO Thing Everyone's Talking About**

Generative Engine Optimization sounds like marketing jargon until you realize what's actually happening. When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best way to optimize blog content?" the AI doesn't just make stuff up. It pulls from sources it considers authoritative and comprehensive. Frase helps you structure content so AI platforms actually read and cite it.

The platform analyzes paragraph length, explanatory depth, question coverage, and structural elements that AI engines prefer. It's not about keyword stuffing for robots. It's about creating content that answers questions thoroughly enough that AI tools trust it as a reference. The GEO score tells you how well you're doing on that front, while the SEO score handles traditional ranking factors.

One reviewer on G2 mentioned something that stuck with me. They said Frase helped someone with "average experience" create content that performed like a seasoned writer produced it. The tools lower the skill floor without capping the ceiling. Experienced writers use the research to move faster. Newer writers use the structure to avoid common mistakes.

**Breaking Down the Pricing Without the Headache**

Pricing models for SEO tools usually make you feel like you need a calculator and a law degree. Frase keeps it straightforward, though you'll want to pay attention to what "content projects per month" actually means. That's the number of new research briefs you can create, not the number of articles you can write or optimize.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Content Projects | Users Included | Key Features | Best For |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $98/mo | 15 projects | 1 user | Basic SEO research, unlimited AI words, 2 Rank-Ready docs/month | Solo creators and freelancers testing the platform |
| **Professional** | $98/mo | 75 projects | 3 users | Advanced SEO/GEO research, 10 Rank-Ready docs/month, 5 brand voice profiles, content opportunities monitoring | Growing teams and agencies managing multiple clients |
| **Scale** | $195/mo | 75 projects | 3 users | Everything in Professional PLUS AI Search Tracking (250 prompts across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude), 3 brands tracked, 6-month historical data | Teams serious about monitoring AI search visibility |
| **Advanced** | $297/mo | 75 projects | 5 users | Advanced AI tracking (350 prompts), 10 brands tracked, 24-month historical trends, priority support | Larger agencies and enterprises |

The Rank-Ready Documents deserve explanation because they're not included in the unlimited AI writing. Those are fully automated articles where you input a keyword and Frase generates a complete, SEO-optimized draft without you touching the editor. Think of them as the express lane—$$3.50$$ per document if you run out of your monthly allocation, or you can buy bundles if you're scaling content production.

Everyone gets unlimited AI words for writing and optimizing within the editor. The monthly limits apply only to how many new research projects you initiate and how many fully automated Rank-Ready articles you generate. Once a project exists, you can optimize and rewrite it as many times as you want.

**Features That Actually Save Time**

The content brief builder is where Frase shows its hand. You enter a target keyword, and within about 30 seconds, you get an outline pulled from analyzing the SERP. It extracts headings from top-ranking pages, identifies questions from Google's People Also Ask boxes, Reddit threads, and Quora discussions, and suggests topics to cover based on what's missing from your current draft.

The SERP analysis panel sits alongside your editor, showing which topics competitors cover and which keywords they use. You're not copying their content—you're identifying gaps and opportunities. If every top result mentions a specific subtopic you've skipped, that's probably not accidental.

One feature that doesn't get enough attention is the competitor export function. You can dump all those headings and keywords into a spreadsheet for further analysis outside the platform. Agencies appreciate this because they can process the data through their own workflows without staying locked in Frase's interface.

The Brand Voice profiles let you train the AI writer on your style. Feed it examples of your best content, and it tries to match that tone when generating new drafts. The effectiveness varies—some users say it nails their voice immediately, while others say it takes iteration. Either way, it's better than generic AI output that sounds like a robot wrote it.

Content Opportunities monitoring is sneaky useful. Connect your Google Search Console, and Frase watches for pages where your rankings drop or where search queries shift. It alerts you when content needs refreshing, so you're not manually checking analytics every week.

For teams working across multiple clients or brands, the collaboration features matter more than the writing tools. You can share optimization links with writers outside your paid account, which means you're not buying seats for everyone who touches content. The approval workflow lets editors review drafts without jumping into a separate project management tool.

Before diving deeper into how Frase stacks up against alternatives, it's worth seeing how the optimization interface actually guides your writing. 👉 [Explore Frase's optimization tools](https://www.frase.io/?via=li68) to understand how the real-time scoring works as you write. The color-coded suggestions and topic coverage tracking give immediate feedback, so you're not wondering whether you've hit the mark until after publishing.

**AI Search Tracking: The New Frontier**

This is where Frase gets ahead of the curve. The Scale and Advanced plans include tracking for how often your brand gets mentioned in responses from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude. You enter prompts related to your industry, and Frase monitors which sources the AI engines cite when answering those questions.

If you're tracking "best project management software" and your product never appears in AI responses while competitors dominate, that's actionable intelligence. You can adjust content strategy to match what AI platforms value, not just what ranks on Google.

The historical data tracking (6 months on Scale, 24 months on Advanced) shows trends over time. Are you gaining ground in AI citations or losing visibility? The competitor share-of-voice analysis compares your mention frequency against rivals, giving you a benchmark beyond traditional SEO metrics.

Daily monitoring and alerts mean you don't manually check AI responses every morning. When your visibility shifts significantly, you get notified. For brands where AI search matters—software tools, professional services, educational content—this tracking justifies the higher-tier pricing on its own.

**What Users Actually Say (Not the Marketing Copy)**

G2 reviews paint an interesting picture. The platform holds a 4.8-star rating from hundreds of reviewers, with most praise focusing on the research and optimization workflow. One content manager mentioned, "We're a small company constantly reviewing which tools we pay for, but Frase is always a constant. It saves us time, makes our content more competitive, and it's one of the few tools we recommend every client invest in."

The criticisms fall into predictable categories. Some users find the AI writing repetitive, though they clarify the research features remain valuable. Others mention the learning curve for first-time users, suggesting the onboarding could guide people through features more intuitively. A few note that while Frase automates research, human judgment still matters for structuring and writing meaningful content—it's an assistant, not a replacement.

Trustpilot shows more mixed sentiment, with complaints mostly centered on technical issues and customer service response times. One user noted frustration with inconsistent performance. It's worth remembering that unhappy customers tend to be louder than satisfied ones, and Trustpilot often attracts people specifically looking to vent. The G2 reviews, which require verification and come from actual users in professional settings, trend significantly more positive.

A verified G2 reviewer who leads a product team said, "The automatic content brief creation drastically reduces content creation time. We put in our keyword, Frase creates a clear brief our writers follow, saving hours of work. The AI writer and SEO addon are amazing too—you just have to try it to see how fast you can write original articles with SEO in mind."

**Comparing Frase to the Alternatives**

Frase exists in a crowded market. Surfer SEO, Clearscope, MarketMuse, Jasper, and Writesonic all compete for the same content optimization audience. Each tool makes different trade-offs.

Surfer focuses heavily on on-page optimization with a structured content editor that's arguably more polished than Frase's. However, Surfer doesn't include GEO optimization or AI search tracking. If you only care about ranking on Google, Surfer might edge ahead. If you're thinking about where content discovery is headed, Frase's dual focus makes more sense.

Clearscope excels at optimizing existing content quickly. Their interface is clean, their recommendations are fast, and their pricing reflects that premium positioning. Frase costs less and includes AI writing features Clearscope doesn't offer. The question is whether you need those features or prefer Clearscope's streamlined approach.

MarketMuse operates at a different level entirely, using content intelligence to identify gaps across your entire site. It's more strategic than tactical, with pricing that reflects enterprise positioning. Frase feels more accessible for smaller teams who need immediate writing help, not just strategic planning.

Jasper and Writesonic lean toward AI content generation with less emphasis on research and optimization. They'll help you write faster, but they won't guide you through competitive analysis the way Frase does. If you already know what to write and just need help producing it quickly, those tools work. If you need help figuring out what to write in the first place, Frase's research layer adds value.

One medium article comparing Frase to Surfer after a three-month real-world test concluded: "When it came to research and outlining, Frase won. It's not even close. Its ability to analyze the top 20 competitors, pull their headings, and organize everything is superior."

**The Rank-Ready Documents Thing**

This feature deserves its own section because it's either brilliant or concerning, depending on your perspective. You enter a target keyword, and Frase generates a complete article optimized for both SEO and GEO without you touching the editor. The output includes headings, body paragraphs, keyword optimization, and structural elements AI platforms prefer.

The pricing model is interesting. Each plan includes a monthly allocation (2 for Starter, 10 for Professional and above), then you can buy more for $$3.50$$ each or purchase bundles for volume discounts. This positions Rank-Ready as an overflow option rather than your primary content creation method.

Reviews split on quality. Some users call the output surprisingly good for a first draft that needs light editing. Others say the content feels generic and requires substantial rewriting to match their standards. The truth probably depends on the topic complexity and how competitive the keyword is. For straightforward informational content in less competitive niches, the automated approach might work fine. For thought leadership or high-stakes commercial content, you'll likely treat it as an outline rather than a finished product.

The bigger question is whether fully automated content aligns with your brand voice and quality standards. Frase isn't hiding what this is—it's explicitly a tool for scaling content production quickly. Whether that serves your goals depends on your publication standards and how much editing time you're willing to invest.

If you're considering whether the automation features or the manual optimization tools matter more for your workflow, 👉 [try Frase's free trial](https://www.frase.io/?via=li68) to test both approaches. The trial includes access to the editor, research tools, and optimization scoring so you can see which features actually fit your process before committing to a plan.

**Who This Tool Actually Serves**

Frase works best for specific use cases. Content marketers managing multiple clients appreciate the brief-sharing capability and the ability to track optimization across projects. SEO professionals who need deep competitive research without opening 20 tabs save substantial time. Small agency teams benefit from the collaboration features and multi-user access starting at the Professional tier.

Solo bloggers and freelancers on the Starter plan get enough projects for regular content production without paying for features they won't use. The 15 monthly content projects translates to roughly one every two days, which covers most individual publishing schedules.

The tool is less compelling for purely creative writing that doesn't need SEO optimization, technical documentation where search visibility matters less than accuracy, or news content where speed trumps optimization. Frase optimizes content for discovery, not for writing speed or creative quality.

Larger enterprises with complex approval processes and multiple brands might find the Professional or Scale plans limiting. The Advanced plan adds more users and brand tracking, but true enterprise needs often require custom solutions. Frase offers custom Enterprise pricing for teams that need unlimited projects, multi-account structures, and dedicated support.

**The Features You Didn't Know You Needed**

Beyond the obvious content optimization and AI writing, Frase includes smaller tools that users mention appreciating once they discover them. The 40+ free AI writing tools cover specific use cases like Instagram captions, email subject lines, meta descriptions, and FAQ sections. These aren't just templates—they're individual AI models trained for specific outputs.

The Chrome extension brings Frase optimization to any content management system. If you write in WordPress, Webflow, Notion, or any web-based editor, the extension adds the optimization sidebar without forcing you into Frase's native editor. This matters more than it sounds like it would.

The content intelligence chatbot turns your existing content into an interactive knowledge base. Visitors can ask questions and get answers pulled directly from your published content, with zero hallucinations because it only references what you've written. This doubles as a content gap detection tool—when visitors ask questions your content can't answer, that's your next topic.

The API add-on lets developers integrate Frase's SERP analysis and NLP processing into custom workflows. Agencies building white-label solutions or companies with proprietary content systems can leverage Frase's capabilities without adopting the entire platform.

Multilingual support covers 159 countries and any language, not just the major European languages most tools support. If you're optimizing content in Vietnamese, Arabic, or Portuguese, Frase handles it the same way it handles English.

**Discount Codes and Promotions for 2026**

Multiple coupon sites claim various Frase discounts for 2026, though the legitimacy varies. Several sites mention codes like FRASE50 for 50% off the first month or FRASE20 for 20% off, though these codes appear to be recycled promotional offers that may or may not currently work.

The most reliable discount is Frase's own annual billing option, which provides a consistent 15% savings compared to monthly payments. For the Professional plan, that's $$204$$ saved annually. For the Scale plan, it's $$408$$ in savings. The Advanced plan saves $$624$$ per year with annual billing.

Rather than hunting for discount codes that might be expired or invalid, the annual billing discount is guaranteed and substantial. Plus, Frase offers a 7-day money-back guarantee on all plans, so you're not locked in if the tool doesn't fit your workflow. The free trial requires no credit card and gives immediate access to the platform, letting you test features before any payment discussion happens.

Some affiliate sites claim 60-75% discounts, but these appear to be theoretical maximum savings or lifetime deal promotions that are no longer active. When evaluating promotional claims, the annual billing discount and the free trial remain the most straightforward ways to reduce costs.

**The Learning Curve Question**

Several reviewers mention Frase isn't immediately intuitive if you're new to content optimization tools. The platform tries to do a lot, and the interface reflects that ambition. You've got the editor, the research panel, the optimization sidebar, the outline builder, and the analytics dashboard all accessible from different tabs.

The video tutorials help, though one reviewer noted they could be improved with more real-world workflow examples rather than feature explanations. The community forum includes users sharing strategies for incorporating Frase into different workflows, which provides practical guidance beyond the official documentation.

Most users report comfort with the platform within a week of regular use. The brief builder is intuitive enough that you can share links with writers who've never seen Frase before, and they figure it out quickly. The optimization interface makes sense once you understand that you're not trying to hit 100% on every metric—you're using the scores as guides, not mandates.

The API and advanced features require more technical knowledge, but those aren't features most users touch. For the core use case of researching topics, creating briefs, and optimizing drafts, the learning curve is manageable.

**Making the Decision**

Frase fits a specific profile. If you produce SEO content regularly, care about ranking on Google while staying ahead of AI search trends, work with teams that need collaboration features, and want research integrated with writing rather than scattered across multiple tools, then Frase makes sense.

It's less compelling if you're purely focused on writing quality over search visibility, already have established SEO workflows with tools you trust, need enterprise-grade features like SSO and custom SLA support, or prefer specialized tools that do one thing exceptionally over platforms that do many things competently.

The GEO optimization is either a visionary feature that prepares you for the future of search or a speculative bet on trends that might not materialize the way Frase predicts. Your assessment of that gamble probably depends on how much you believe AI search will actually disrupt traditional SEO in the next few years.

Before you decide whether this tool fits your content strategy, it's worth testing the workflow with your actual content. 👉 [Start your free Frase trial](https://www.frase.io/?via=li68) and create a brief for a topic you're currently researching. See whether the competitor analysis saves you time, whether the optimization suggestions align with your quality standards, and whether the collaboration features simplify your team workflow. The tool either clicks with your process or it doesn't—the trial answers that question faster than any review.

The pricing positions Frase as more accessible than premium tools like Clearscope while offering more depth than basic AI writing assistants. The dual SEO and GEO focus differentiates it from competitors still focused exclusively on Google rankings. Whether that differentiation matters depends on how you think about content discovery over the next several years.

For teams already stretched thin producing content, Frase removes friction from the research and optimization phases. For solo creators who wear multiple hats, it consolidates tools you'd otherwise need separately. For agencies managing client content at scale, the collaboration features and brief-sharing capability streamline handoffs between team members.

The platform isn't perfect. The AI writing quality varies by topic and requires editing. The learning curve exists, even if it's not steep. The pricing tiers require careful evaluation of which features you actually need versus which sound impressive but won't get used. Still, for content teams focused on search visibility across both traditional and AI-powered search, Frase addresses real workflow problems rather than inventing needs that don't exist.
